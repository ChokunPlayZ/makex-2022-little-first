In this repo, you can find a Python script that powers the "trash on wheels", it was so bad the referee asked "how is this thing even driveable"  
it's the robot that is made off parts that is a leftover from other bots, the design is terrible but it still works for some reason, we did get higher place than the team that bought all new parts somehow lol.

the original code is written in blocks but I've refactored it to the python version, remove clutter and make it simplier.

The script includes a custom Python intellisense for the following components:
- MakeBlock NovaPi
- NovaPi Power Expander Board
- Makeblock Power Management Module
- MakeBlock Bluetooth Gamepad
- mBuild Sensors (Smart Camera, Ranging, Button, LED Matrix, Servo Driver)
- Encoder Motor, Smart Servo
